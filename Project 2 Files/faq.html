                <p>What accommodations and dining locations are available when visiting my student?
                    With the city of Kent becoming a rising college town and the universityâ€™s proximity to other metropolitan areas and national park systems, you will find lots of options:</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.kent.edu/visitor-information">Locate lodging information</a></li> 
                <li><a href="https://www.kent.edu/go/town">City of Kent resources</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.kent.edu/node/12296">Review the Residence Hall Vistitaion policy</a></li>  
                <p>How will I be able to contact my student?<br/>
                    Communication with your student is available by phone, email and mail. Every Kent State student will receive a unique email address for his or her own academic use. If your student did not bring his or her own computer to school, there are numerous computer labs available throughout campus for your student to use. Many students are relying on cell phones as opposed to the land-line phones located in the residence halls. Each student who resides on campus has his or her own mailbox for postal service.</p>
